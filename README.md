# Keelapp (WIP name)

## Description 
You know how the saying goes when it comes to languages: _You either use it, or you lose it._ Once you've learned to speak a foreign language, it's easy to forget some of it when you start learning a new one.
The main purpose of this project is to help you revise your vocabulary in many languages at the same time, so you won't forget any of them while learning a new one.

## NB!
At this point, we're at full development of core functions of the app. All the basic functionalities are not yet done, so we consider this a pre-alpha. Once this stage is done, we'll implement branches to help incorporate gradually new functionalities and allow users to interact with the app for the real Alpha stage, and eventually to a Beta. Updates will be posted here on the repository's README.

## What does it do? 
This tool is meant for people learning a new language, so they can simultaneously revise the new vocabulary in other languages they might know, so that information won't be forgotten. Words can be organized through tags, so it's easier to aggregate related content (units on a book for example).
Each type of word (part of speech) has its own custom form, which varies depending on the language, so you can capture in full detail the content you're learning, and have it at hand to revise.
Activities and games will be added once all the word-management functions are done. A social component will also be added, to help you share collections of words with friends, and propose challenges to one another in case they are native speakers of a language you're interested in.

## What it's not 
This is **not** meant to teach you, but to simply be a resource where you can store all the different words you'll be learning and include their translation in as many languages as you want, so in the future you can practice your skills in all of them simultaneously, instead of one a time.

## Contributing
We're currently not looking for contributions. Once the project is up and running will open channels of communication to help us track bugs and features. Thank you!
